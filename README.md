  Bluenote is simply the best companion app to get in your next jam session!
</div>

## The task

The goal of the app is to help finding the tone of a music piece while
experimenting in jam sessions by inferring it from a given set of notes sorted
by importance.

The protocol is the following:
1. The player tries several notes on top of the music
2. until finding several notes which felt and sound _good_ -- most probably the
   tonic and the dominant.
3. Then, the app infers the potential tone and provides the corresponding key
   signatures along with main chords.
4. The player can give a feedback by precising which notes are in or not.
5. Repeat 1-4. until a unique tone matches the set of notes.
